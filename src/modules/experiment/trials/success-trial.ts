/**
 * @class SuccessScreenPlugin
 * @description A custom jsPsych plugin that displays a success or failure message based on the outcome of the previous trial.
 *
 * The trial includes:
 * - Displaying a large green "Success" message if the previous trial succeeded, or a large red "Failed" message if it did not.
 * - Monitoring the state of specified keys during the trial (to pass to releaseKeysStep)
 * - Automatically ending the trial after a specified duration.
 * - Collecting data about the keys' state and whether the trial was marked as successful.
 *
 * @param {Object} jsPsych - The jsPsych instance used to control the experiment's flow.
 *
 * @method trial - Executes the trial, handling UI setup, key event monitoring, and trial termination.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - `trial_duration` (INT): The duration for which the success or failure message is displayed, in milliseconds.
 * - `task` (STRING): A label for the task being executed (default is "success").
 * - `success` (BOOL): A flag indicating whether the previous trial was successful (default is false).
 *
 * @method handleKeyUp - Handles the `keyup` event, updating the keys' state when they are released.
 * @method isSuccess - Determines whether the previous trial was successful by checking the trial data.
 * @method end_trial - Ends the trial, cleans up event listeners, and sends the recorded data (keys' state and success) to jsPsych.
